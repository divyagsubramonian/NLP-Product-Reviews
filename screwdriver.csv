"i have noticed that some of my bits are starting to wear out from the tip, but that is totally normal wear and tear after use. i am quite happy for the paint job, cause it is still holding extremely well. even better than iron in the tip :ddd"
"bits are okay. they are standard, they're short to fit the screwdriver"
"very happy with the quality and fit of these bits, i would really appreciate a jis set (japanese industrial standard) which look similar to phillips, but are required for working on many japanese devices, which are easily stripped by phillips drivers."
my friend loves the bits. especially the torex ones cause alot stuff he works on uses the torex bits
just need these to go with the screwdriver.
