# NLP-Product-Reviews

GOAL: Build a product to assist businesses in effectively advertising by identifying the most and least favored/influential products in their catalog and the reasons behind it.

OUTLINE: 
Step 1: Look at the sentiment of a certain product’s reviews by using a pre-trained model to conduct sentiment analysis
Step 2: We would also look for word significance and correlation (between numerical ratings, dates, and word associations) by building a plugin for ChatGPT → “siphon” review data into a CSV file first and give that to ChatGPT
